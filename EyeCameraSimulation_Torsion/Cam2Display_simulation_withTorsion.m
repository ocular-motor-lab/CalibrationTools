function out = Cam2Display_simulation_OpenIrisWay(inputPosition, eyeModelCenter, eyeModelRadius, simTorsion )
% output three quaternions:
% 1: in the camera view, quaternion moving the eye from the final position 
% to the axis perpendicular to camera plane
% 2: quaternion moving the eye around the axis perpendicular to camera
% plane (torsion)
% 3: from the camera view final position to the display coordinates
